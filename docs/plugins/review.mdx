# Review

This plugin allow administrators to review commands before they are executed or allowing time based sessions.

Multiple **approval groups** may be used to approve a connection. The command is only executed when all groups are approved.

## Time Based Sessions (JIT)

When enabled for a connection, the user will be able to interact with the connection based on the requested time.

The command below asks for a 10 minutes access to the connection `bash`

```shell
$ hoop connect bash --duration 10m
⣷ waiting session to be approved at https://app.hoop.dev/plugins/reviews/73a28154-58...
```

After approved, the user could connect again without prompting for review during 10 minutes.

:::info
A JIT review could be revoked.
:::

## One Time

It will ask for a review every time a command is issued.

```shell
$ hoop exec bash -i 'ls -l'
⣷ waiting session to be approved at https://app.hoop.dev/plugins/reviews/73a28154-58...
```

## Configuring

Create the review plugin associating with the connection **bash**. Configure the approval groups `sre` and `devops`

```shell
hoop admin create connection bash -a default -- bash
hoop admin create plugin review --overwrite --connection 'bash:sre;devops'
```

Create a connection and associate to the existing plugin review
