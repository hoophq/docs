# Big Query (bq cli)

This guide shows how to create a layer of control on top of the [bq command line](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool)

## Requirements

- [Hoop Command Line](../installing/command-line)
- [GCP Account with BigQuery Permissions](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Big Query Setup

1. Setup the Bigquery following the topics bellow

- [Before You Begin](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/examples/load-data-console#before-you-begin)
- [Create a Dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/examples/load-data-console#create_a_dataset)
- [Download the source Data File](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/examples/load-data-console#download_the_source_data_file)
- [Load data into table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/examples/load-data-console#load_data_into_a_table)


2. Create a service account with the following permissions:

- BigQuery User
- BigQuery Data Viewer

3. Create a JSON type service account key and store in a safe place

For the sake of this guide, we're following the gcp guide to interact with bigquery.

In case you already have a testing dataset, you can skip this part

## Hoop Setup

In your local machine, start hoop

```shell
hoop start
```

## Interacting with Datasets

Create the `bq query` query Connection

<ConnectOnHoopButton text='Create Connection'
  url="http://127.0.0.1:8009/connections/command-line/new?data=eyJuYW1lIjoiYnFxdWVyeSIsInR5cGUiOiJjb21tYW5kLWxpbmUiLCJzZWNyZXQiOnsiZmlsZXN5c3RlbTpLRVlfRklMRSI6IiJ9LCJjb21tYW5kIjpbImJxIiwgInF1ZXJ5IiwgIi0tbG9jYXRpb24iLCAiVVMiLCAiLS11c2VfbGVnYWN5X3NxbD1mYWxzZSIsICItLWpvYl9pZCIsICIkSE9PUF9TRVNTSU9OX0lEIl0sICJhZ2VudF9pZCI6ICIifQ=="
/> <br /> <br />

:::info
Add the JSON service account into the `KEY_FILE` input
:::

This will allow interacting with the [bq command line](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool)

1. Try to execute a query

```shell
hoop exec -v bqquery -i 'SELECT * FROM babynames.names_2014 LIMIT 1'
```

### Interacting with Jobs

Create a `bq head` connection

<ConnectOnHoopButton text='Create Connection'
  url="http://127.0.0.1:8009/connections/command-line/new?data=eyJuYW1lIjoiYnFoZWFkIiwidHlwZSI6ImNvbW1hbmQtbGluZSIsInNlY3JldCI6eyJmaWxlc3lzdGVtOktFWV9GSUxFIjoiIn0sImNvbW1hbmQiOlsiYnEiLCAiaGVhZCJdLCAiYWdlbnRfaWQiOiAiIn0="
/> <br /> <br />


2. Try to fetch it with `bq head -j <session-id>`

The previous command was adding the **session id as the job id** of executed queries on bigquery, thus we could use the previous session id to fetch it.

```shell
hoop exec bqhead -- -j <PREVIOUS_SESSION_ID>
```

## More Patterns

The bq command line has other actions that could be used as patterns with Hoop.

**Allow jobs to be async**

```shell
$ bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --nosynchronous_mode
```

This allow the pattern of consulting the previous job with `bq head --job_id ...`. It's useful for queries that take too long to execute.

**Dry-run commands**

Dry run allows showing how much of bytes will be consumed

```shell
$ bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM babynames.names_2014 limit 5' --dry_run
Query successfully validated. Assuming (...), running this query will process 654791 bytes of data.
```

A plugin could allow queries that has passed by the `--dry-run` mode.

**Command Line Quota**

bq allows specifying the maximum bytes billed, this option could be used as a retriction mechanism

```shell
$ bq query \
  --use_legacy_sql=false \
  --maximum_bytes_billed 1 \
  'SELECT * FROM babynames.names_2014 limit 100;'

BigQuery error in query operation: Error processing job
'myproject:bqjob_r107f63c4f31d3d37_000001860d50d5f8_1': Query exceeded
limit for bytes billed: 1. 10485760 or higher required.
```
